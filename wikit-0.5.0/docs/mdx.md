# MDX/MDD

MDX/MDD is a popular closed-source dictionary format which you can find many dictionaries made by a
variety of folks on [pdawiki](https://www.pdawiki.com) or [freemdict](https://freemdict.com/).
All of these should give appreciations to the hero of `xwang` who firstly released full
reverse-engineering analysis of MDX/MDD format, which you can find
[here](https://bitbucket.org/xwang/mdict-analysis/src/master/).
I have made a new image to illustrate MDX format which is showed below (you can
view it in fullscreen [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ikey4u/wikit/master/docs/imgs/mdx-format.svg)):
